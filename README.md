## Record Collector

Collecting records can be a random, beautiful, and frustrating experience.  Buying duplicates or having your mind go blank whenever you enter a store or see a crate for sale is a real problem. This app will enable the user to create a unique list of their records and create a wishlist using the Spotify API.  The Spotify API will also enable the user to quickly populate data so the tedium of entering every detail is removed from the process of cataloguing what they already own.  This app is a complete organizational resource for the casual to serious collector while also functioning as a digitized version of their collection.
